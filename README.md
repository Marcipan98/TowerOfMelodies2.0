# TowerOfMelodies2.0  
  
All of the scenes work properly, but when trying to access mini games from the main levels they start too quickly and it shows that a player lost. The only way for the mini game to start working is to open its scene. The player has to press spacebar when the bar touches the lights.  
  
There are no win or lose screens at the end, only in the console screen.  
  
Borders don't work properly (I only noticed as I was trying to upload the game on GitHub) even though the Confiner game object has a Polygon Collider 2D component added to it, which has the collider assigned properly.
