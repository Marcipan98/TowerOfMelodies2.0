# TowerOfMelodies2.0  

All of the scenes work properly, but when trying to access mini games from the main levels they start too quickly and it shows that a player lost
There are no win or lose screens at the end, only in the console screen.
Borders don't work properly (I only noticed as I was trying to upload the game on GitHub) even though the Confiner game object has a Polygon Collider 2D component added to it, which has the collider assigned properly
